*INTRO*
The COVID-19 pandemic has produced a unique set of public health challenges. But the pandemic has exacerbated national crises that existed long before the coronavirus. Nowhere is this more evident than in the pandemicâ€™s influence on homelessness and affordable housing. In our project we present data from the NYC Department of Homeless Services to analyze how the department was effected by the pandemic and whether or not the programs they put in place during this time were effective.

*BASELINE HOMELESSNESS GRAPH* (before graph, after intro)
Here, we plotted the monthly homelessness. We used a polynomial regression to fit the data, we trained the model using only the pre-pandemic data and used the trained model to predict homelessness in the months after the pandemic hit. This model gives us an idea of what homelessness would look like if there were no pandemic. When we compared the post-pandemic predicted homelessness numbers to the actual homelessness numbers, we see that the predicted homelessness from the model are significantly lower than the real numbers. This re-enforces the idea that the homelessness crisis was exacerbated during the pandemic and the NYC Department of Homeless Services had to do something to mitigate this crisis. Whether or not these numbers would have been higher if the Department of Homeless Services hadn't initiated any extra programs is hard to say.

*COVID-19 MAP*
Here, we present a general look at the pandemic in New York City by each borough. 

*COVID-19 FREE MEALS*
One program that the Department of Homeless Services did start during the pandemic was to offer free meals to homeless people. Here, we made a map that shows where these free meals are available.

*HOMELESS SHELTERS*
We can search homeless shelter data by borough. By exploring the data we see that the DHS made more shelters over time.
